  ._.-.___.' (`\
 //(        ( `'
'/ )\ ).__. ) 
' <' `\ ._/'\
   `   \     \
```

## how to use

```bash
git clone http://github.com/if-not-nil/horse
cd horse
go build
```

at first, i recommend you do

```bash
alias h="horse && cat /tmp/horselast"
```

then, when you know what does what, 
```bash
alias h="horse && source /tmp/horselast"
```

use it like you would `cd ls cd ls`  
try opening folders and files with tab
try pressing backspace when in a folder  
try pressing enter
try going to a folder and pressing enter  
try doing `Down`, `Up`, `<C-n>`, `<C-p>`, `<C-j>`, `<C-k>`
try doing `<C-c>` and see how its different from `Enter`
